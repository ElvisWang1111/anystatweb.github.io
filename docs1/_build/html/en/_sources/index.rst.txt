Introduction to Anystat
---------

Anystat, dedicated to becoming your data analysis copilot.

We are pursuing a user-friendly data analysis Agent framework that covers the entire end-to-end process, can continuously optimize results through multi-round interactions with users, and has the capability to carry LLM technology iterations over the next five years, helping you efficiently advance every step of your analysis tasks.

Features

   <h3><span class="highlight-text">Write Code, Unlock Data Analysis Potential</span></h3>

- Coding is compatible with tool calls and independent development. Agents can not only accurately understand user needs, flexibly call existing tools, but also independently write new tools according to requirements, balancing stability and flexibility, and carrying the overflow of future model capabilities.
